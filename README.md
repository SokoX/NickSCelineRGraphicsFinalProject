Procedural Terrain Generation

DESCRIPTION:
We used the Diamond Square algorithm to procedurally generate height-maps to create terrain. Additionally, we used the generated height-map to generate a color-map. 

HOW TO USE:

to run:
first run:
./lab [terrain name] [water level] [color mode] [variance]

- the terrain name indicates the filepath the heighmap and color map are generated to.

- the water level indicates what height water will spawn
at on any generated terrains.

- the color specifies the color scheme to generate the terrain with.

color mode 1 will use:

color mode 2 will use:

color mode 3 will use:

any other number will use:

- variance defines the random value used to diversify the frequency of peaks in the terrain as the algorithm carries out.

user-interactions:
- Use WASD keys to move around the terrain.
- Use mouse to look around. 
- Press Q to quit. 
- Press R to re-generate the terrain.
